    dcterms:description """Ontology for the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS), a framework of statistical areas used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and other organisations to enable the publication of statistics that are comparable and spatially integrated. This ontology contains the definitions for the ABS Structures which are areas that the ABS designs specifically for outputting statistics.

ABS structures: 

- Mesh Block, Statistical Areas (Level 1 to Level 4), Greater Capital City Statistical Areas, State or Territory, Country classes
- Indigenous location, Indigenous area, Indigenous region 
- Urban Centre and Locality, Section of State Range, Section of State, Significant Urban Area

Non ABS Structures which are not defined or maintained by the ABS but represent administrative areas for which the ABS is committed to providing a range of statistics. 
The classes defined here corresponds to ABS approximations of spatial areas or regions which are defined elsewhere

- Local Government Areas (LGAs)
- Postal Areas (POAs)
- State Suburbs (SSCs)
- Commonwealth Electoral Divisions (CEDs)
- State Electoral Divisions (SEDs)
- Australian Drainage Divisions (ADDs)
- Natural Resource Management Regions (NRMRs)
- Tourism Regions (TRs)

The ASGS uses Mesh Blocks as a common building block for all structures. Mesh Blocks are small enough that they can accurately approximate the changing administrative areas maintained by other organisations, without changing themselves.

The publication of the ASGS ontology is part of the Australian Bureau of Statistics contribution to a joint effort to publish authoritative, interconnected spatial products (Location Index project).

The ASGS Ontology is packaged in multiple graphs:

- http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs (this graph) contains the core classes for ASGS statistical units, and a small number of properties relating to their identity, classification, and containment hierarchy
- http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs-cat contains the meshblock classification scheme
- http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs-id contains specialised string types for identifiers and labels
- http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs-path contains association classes and properties relating to paths between instances of the core classes
- http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs-isof (deprecated) contains specialized predicates for containment relationships - this functionality is provided by generic 'within' and 'isComposedOf' relations instead
- http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs-code (deprecated) contains specialised annotation properties for identifiers and labels - this functionality has been superseded by a set of data-types to be used in conjunction with more generic properties
- http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs-prop (deprecated) contains specialised ASGS properties for relationships, classifiers, identifiers and labels - this functionality has been superseded by use of types from standardized RDF vocabularies""" ;

A **place-name** is a text string in a specified language that is 

- assigned by an agent (person or organization)
- assigned a designated 'status', with default="informal"
- denotes a natural or constructed location 

An **official-place-name** is a **place-name** that also 

- is authorized by a place-naming-authority, often a jurisidiction (national, state or local government) 
- is a member item in a gazetteer
- has lifecycle information (status, dates) 

Each individual place-name or official-place-name is associated with one **place**. 

A **place** is 

- a location with at least a point geometry
- which has a specified classification (inhabited place, administrative area, mountain, school, station, park ...). 
- with one or more names associated with each individual place. 

This ontology uses classes and properties from existing vocabularies, in particular

The PROJECT ontology is designed to enable publication of information describing projects, including research projects. It is not designed to support project management, though sub-activities are included. As far as possible PROJECT is intended to be domain-neutral, and it is expected that domains and applications will specialize or extend this ontology for more specific purposes.

The ontology gives terms to support the representation of:

- project planning, funding, goals
- project stakeholders and relationships
- project activities and timeline

One specialization is included - the **Research Project** - which has been the subject of several predecessor designs that have informed the design of this ontology, including:

- In [FOAF](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/) the foaf:Project class is a stub (no specific properties) which was included primarily to act as the topic of a homepage
- [Description of a Project ontology (DOAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOAP) is oriented to software development projects
- [Funding, Research Administration and Projects Ontology (FRAPO)](http://purl.org/cerif/frapo) is aimed at describing administrative information relating to grant funding and research projects. 
- [Project Documents Ontology (PDO)](http://vocab.deri.ie/pdo) relates to  various documents in a project-specific setting, like meeting minutes, status reports etc
- In [VIVO-ISF](https://github.com/openrif/vivo-isf-ontology) the [vivo:Project](http://vivoweb.org/ontology/core#Project) class is very lightweight, characterised only by its timing and geographic focus

The [DBPedia ontology](http://dbpedia.org/ontology/) provides what is probably the most general purpose class for projects: [dbo:Project](http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Project) is described as "a temporary endeavor undertaken to achieve defined objectives" and has key properties relating to timing, objectives, and classification (keywords).

PROJECT extends the W3C PROV-O ontology. Otherwise, it has no dependencies except for the normal RDF/OWL infrastructure ([RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/), [RDFS](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/), [OWL2](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-quick-reference/)), [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/2010/10/11/dcmi-terms/) for some ontology metadata, and [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) to support some relationships between Role values, and project classification.

A summary of the main classes and relationships in PROJECT is shown in the diagram below, including the key superclass `prov:Activity`.
